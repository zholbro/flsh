# FLSH

## what is it?
An API designed to track public utilities you find useful,
such as public bathrooms, power outlets in buildings,
public wifi, water fountains, and so on. It is a project
submitted for CMPS 183 at UC Santa Cruz, by Brooke Dalton,
Tarum Fraz, Zach Holbrook, Beth Oliver, and Devin Siems.
Included is the backend server code, as well as a toy
frontend.

## how does it work?
The server is written mostly in Flask, with Flask
extensions Flask-RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy.
The frontend is just going to be Leaflet.js on top of
HTML.

## how do I set it up?
You'll probably need to install Flask, Flask-RESTful,
and Flask-SQLAlchemy through pip. Forwarding to static
IP is left up to you! We're just starting this up.
Just kidding! It's still being written! If you think you
can do this better than us, fork this. Hopefull this will
be done by week 10 of the Winter Quarter 2018.
