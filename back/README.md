# Bathroom Interactions Requirements
All interactions can just give arguments to request.args
## /flsh
Request to /flsh without arguments returns all possible bathrooms.
### Optional arguments
Arguments should be exclusive; i.e. submitting multiple arguments won't join the query.
1. `rating`: Filling this returns all bathrooms >= value.
2. `gender`: Filters bathrooms by exclusive gender.
3. `latitude`,`longitude`, & `range`: Range should be expressed in miles. Unfinished, but [this](http://janmatuschek.de/LatitudeLongitudeBoundingCoordinates) is how we would theoretically handle in implementation.
## /flsh/new
Creates a new bathroom entry, as well as other bits of data.
1. `name`: Name for Bathroom. 20 char.
2. `building`: Name for building bathroom is in. 20 char.
3. `address`: Address of building. Nominatim should handle. 80 char. Optional.
4. `floor`: Integer. Optional, default is 1.  Floor building is on. 
5. `gender`: 10 char. Should be defined in front-end as a trinary option between `male`, `female`, and `all`.
5. `cleanliness`: Float. Initial rating of bathroom quality.
6. `latitude`: FLSH will parse this parameter as float, and front-end should not use degrees/minutes/seconds notation. Ex.
`36.995769` and not `36Â° 59' 44.7684'' N`.
7. `longitude`: Same as above.
8. `text`: The initial review of a bathroom. Optional.
## /flsh/add_review
Adds a review to the associated bathroom, and averages reviews.
1. `id`: The ID of the bathroom in the bathroom table. /flsh should give that to you.
2. `cleanliness`: Value of cleanliness for that specific rating.
3. `text`: Review text.
## /flsh/get_reviews
Gives you all reviews for a specific bathroom.
1. `id`: Above description.
## /flsh/delete
Deletes a bathroom, along with its associated review counter and all reviews associated with it.
1. `id`: ID of bathroom.
## /flsh/review_delete
Deletes a bathroom review, recalculates the average.
1. `id`: ID of review. (This is distinct from a bathroom ID)

# Generic Interactions Requirements
## /generic
Returns all generic items in database. Best handled if front-end gives some parameter like
1. `filter`: Value should be category name. i.e. `toaster`, `microwave`, `fountain`, etc.
Latitude and longitude are not implemented yet
## /generic/categories
Lists all categories of items in database. Consistient use of front-end should let end-user explicitly know what categories of item they put in database.
Not implemented as of Spring 3.
